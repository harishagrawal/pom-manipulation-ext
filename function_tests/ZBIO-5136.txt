Functional Test Cases:
--------------
1. Title: Validate the current unpaid card balance
   - Input: None
   - Expected Output: System shows the correct unpaid balance for the card

2. Title: Verify the payment due date
   - Input: None
   - Expected Output: System shows the correct due date for the payment
   - Edge Case: For newly created cards, the payment due date should be one billing cycle from the card issued date

3. Title: Verify if the system triggers a call once the payment date is past due
   - Input: Payment date past due

   - Edge Case: If the payment amount is more than the unpaid balance, the extra amount might be credited to the account

Non-Functional Test Cases:
--------------
1. Title: Check the system's response time when retrieving card balance
   - Expected Output: The system's response time should be within acceptable limits

2. Title: Verify the system's ability to handle multiple users checking their unpaid card balance at the same time
   - Expected Output: The system should be able to handle high concurrent load without performance degradation

3. Title: Test the reliability of the automated call system
   - Expected Output: The automated call system should work flawlessly over a prolonged period of time

4. Title: Test the security of the payment collection process
    - Expected Output: All transactions and card details should be encrypted and secure from breaches
