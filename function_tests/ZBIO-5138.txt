**Functional Test Cases**

1. **Credit Card Due Reminder**
  - Input: Credit Card Due Date is 01/12/2022
  - Expected output: Reminder is sent on 30/11/2022
  - Edge case: If card due date falls on a holiday, reminder should still be sent one day prior

2. **Overdue Balance Alert**
  - Input: Payment due date has passed (i.e. it's 02/12/2022 and due date was 01/12/2022)
  - Expected output: Alert should be sent on 02/12/2022
  
3. **Collection Notification**
  - Input: Account is significantly delinquent
  - Expected output: Collection Notification is sent detailing amount owed and additional charges. 
  - Edge case: Make sure account classification is accurate and not sending notices to accounts just day(s) past due

4. **Payment Plan Proposal**  
  - Input: User informs about inability to pay.
  - Expected output: A payment plan proposal is offered with reduced interest rates or fees.
  - Edge case: This feature should not be triggered by the user in good standing or with minor delinquency

5. **Collection Agency Involvement**  
  - Input: Cardholder fails to respond to previous notifications and reminders
  - Expected output: Collection agency is involved in the process
  - Edge case: Ensure collection agency involvement threshold is accurate, can't involve agency just few days after payment due date
  
6. **Legal Action Initiation**   
  - Input: Extreme cases of non-payment or default.
  - Expected output: Legal action is initiated
  - Edge case: There should be a rigorous confirmation procedure before initiating legal action to prevent undeserved legal hassles to the user

**Non-Functional Test Cases**

1. **Performance Testing**
  - Check if the system can handle the load of sending notifications to all users.
  - Check if the alert system works swiftly and promptly even with thousands of cardholders.

2. **Usability Testing**
  - Test if the notification messages are clear and understandable to the cardholders.
  
3. **Security Testing**
  - Ensure that sensitive cardholder data is protected during interactions.
  
4. **Compatibility Testing**
  - Ensure the notifications are delivered effectively across all different device types that cardholders may use (PCs, mobile phones, tablets).

5. **Recovery Testing**
  - Test if the system can recover from crashes, hardware failures and other similar problems without losing any critical data.

6. **Reliability Testing**
  - Test if the system is able to perform its functions continuously for a long period of time without any disruption.
