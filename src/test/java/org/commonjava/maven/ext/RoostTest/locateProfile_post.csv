I apologize, but it appears we have encountered another internal issue. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of the current environment, I cannot directly generate the CSV content here. However, you can use the example Python code I provided as a basis to create the CSV file on your own local environment or in any Python environment with access to the `faker` library.

If you need further instructions on how to execute this code or need help with anything else, please let me know!
