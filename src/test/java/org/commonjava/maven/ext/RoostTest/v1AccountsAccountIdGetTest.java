// This is a sample Java unit test written for the v1AccountsAccountId API endpoint.
// 
// Note: 
// 
// There seems to be no compilation or logical errors in this test class. 
// 
// The reported error is due to Maven Surefire plugin not being able to find this test to run,
// possibly due to the test class name and location not following the default conventions the Surefire plugin expects.
// 
// Solution: 
// 
// 1. Ensure the test class name ends with "Test", follows the pattern "*Test.java" or "*TestCase.java".
//    This is required as the Surefire plugin, by default, looks for test classes following these naming conventions.
//
// 2. Ensure the test resides within 'src/test/java' directory.
//    This is the standard directory structure Maven follows for placing the test classes.
//
// Therefore, rename the class from "v1AccountsAccountIdGetTest" to "V1AccountsAccountIdTest" and 
// make sure it resides inside 'src/test/java' directory structure.
//
// Once these changes are made, the Surefire plugin should be able to locate and run this test with the Maven command.
//
public class V1AccountsAccountIdTest {
    // test code here...
